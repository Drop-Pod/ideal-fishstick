## Books 

### Civic Tech: Making Technology Work for People 
This book by Andrew R. Schrock is a great shorter read which introduces the core concept of Civic Tech and provides great real-world examples of the impact that can be made. Small groups of innovative teams are incredibly powerful - it is unfortunate that usually the next steps are successfully scaling into a large organization that seeks to destroy that same spirit of innovation.

### Small Giants: Companies That Choose to Be Great Instead of Big
This book is an amazing analysis of company culture and how avoiding growth often appears critical to sustaining innovation and achieving greatness. This book helps explain much of our mindset and would be great to read before joining or shortly afterwards.

### Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World
This book is the reason that I shut down my non-profit and completely reconsidered my approach to making an impact in the world. It shattered some of my illusions and was disruptive to my life, so I would highly recommend it but recommend being prepared to re-think some assumptions. Another key thing it highlighted was the importance of sharing and limiting power - if we focus on building systems that limit individual power, this is a more effective way to ensure proper use of power then bureaucracy.

### Tribe: On Homecoming and Belonging
While I am still searching for my tribe, hopefully someday I will find that place that I belong.

### Unrig: How to Fix Our Broken Democracy
This book is focused on American politics but offers a great analysis of the real problems in our system and proposes ideas around making incremental changes to get us back to a democracy where your vote matters.

### The Ethical Slut
Reading this really helped challenge assumptions that I made about relationship dynamics. It left me with mixed feelings regarding idealizing behavior which society deems taboo but was interesting and helped to better center my values.


### Ugly American

### Rebels at Work
