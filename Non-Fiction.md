## Books 

### Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World
This book is the reason that I shut down my non-profit and completely reconsidered my approach to making an impact in the world. It shattered some of my illusions and was disruptive to my life, so I would highly recommend it

### Tribe: On Homecoming and Belonging
While I am still searching for my tribe, hopefully someday I will find that place that I belong.

### Unrig: How to Fix Our Broken Democracy
This book is focused on American politics but offers a great analysis of the real problems in our system and proposes ideas around making incremental changes to get us back to a democracy where your vote matters.

### The Ethical Slut
Reading this really helped challenge assumptions that I made about relationship dynamics. It left me with mixed feelings regarding idealizing behavior which society deems taboo but was interesting and helped to better center my values.


### Ugly American

### Rebels at Work
